Whats is ffretv-myththangos?
Whats the references to the name?

FFRETV is  a project of mine based of mythtv, thangos is a further customized project based off THingOS.

Furthermore, mythtv is based of qt/ffmpeg/mysql, and ThingOS is based off Buildroot.

It's the great fun world of software develoment that even a non-pro like myself gets to play with.


So what exactly can any of this do?

So far I have a hw accelerated working ffretv(mythtv) 29Fixes running for the RPI2 and THE RPI3 Series.


Why do I do this?  Even though I have not had a personal problem with the mythtv active dev team in years, over 5.


THE LONG EXPLAINATION INCLUDING THE DRAMA about why I dont play with MYTHTV UPSTREAM AT ALL, AND I MEAN NO REIGNDEER GAMES, NONE. So long as they treat people like rudolf they dont understand or cant tolerate.

```
Mythtv I have learned has long sinced needed a good leader for the long run. No matter what temp residents they have.
Fact is they dont seem to have a king like our kernel does. Doesnt seem to me they even have good relationships with the french ffmpeg devs, but what do I know. Anyway, they stagnated a lot until the last and current leader is making a name for himself. That person has from my observation been PB. I think he has done a good job. SHould he have told and SAID NOT DONT PICK "BUZZOFF" as the code name.
That lowers us to a level what dont want percieved. 
BUT HE DIDNT SEEM TO HAVE A SAY OR WANT TO SAY. So there is another reason I havent really even tried to warm up with Peter either. So while my expectations may not be met by mythtv devs on a whole, I'm honest enought to say OKAY, I know my standards are higher than avg.

BUT HEY this how open source shops work, they let a working leader run for a while and run his philosphyes for as long
as he can stand it. Then along comes another star to take the LEAD, doing whatever is on his list.

Meanwhile, more loyal submissive types have been helping mythtv I notice quietly behind the scenes for years, but you dont hear from them much, because I assume they just enjoy the work but not the youthful drama.

Its been rumored that I just like to toy with the mythtv devs and show them a thing or two...
Thats bs and trollish in thought, the reality is I was and am a nerd too and I get to enjoy playing with mythtv.
I've said some not so sweet things about mythtv before, so they hold on to that, no matter what else i do.

Want proof that some people at mythtv like to play games?

When I released my custom build of Automyth28 I dubbed it XmasGift2, which was based off the code name they used upstream they used, XmasGIFT

So some punk  at mythtv thought I'll be real smurt for all those KELSIE's and OTHERS OUT THEIR THAT DONT COME TO OUR SOCIAL PARTIES AND BOW, I WILL POKE THEM.

Well the code name for MYTHTV IS CURRENTLY = BUZZoff. 
REALLY JOHNNY BUZZOFF?

So while I can not take all the credit for their naming shchemas, they still let us all know, they may know some C++ or a scripting language but someone left the playpen open again.

People say I enjoy drama really, if that was true dont you think I would be on the MYTHTV upstream bandwagin singing their songs since the early 2000's if that was really the case?

I have sit by an watched the list of devs go through that place that seems longer than the list for the lnux kernel, so yeah I expect all of personalities have buzzed by mythtv.

Does any of their bumhurt feelings or low expectations of me prevent me from doing my projects?
Have they stopped me by hurting my feelings at ALL?

NONE. I GIVE  BACK TO THEM AND THEY PRETEND I DONT EXIST OR THEY INSULT ME in a closed loop. Uust like RD. I GET NO RESPECT. THATS OKAY THOUGH, I BEEN TAUGHT to raise my standards anyway and that i dont need respect from adults that act like children when it comes to whats important.


BTW, WHEN THIS PERSON TALKS:

WHOM IS WE? IS IT A TINY MOUSE IN THE POCKET OR IS HE ADMITING THEY ALL IMMATURE?

Comment from user about the name:
"Maybe they really meant this "Using protocol version 91 BuzzOff" ????"



So while they work out the ADVERTISING POLITICS IN MYTHTV UPSTREAM they can get patches from people tired of their chit by searching them. If they want help they can try not to offend and pretend everyone their now wrote every single code peice.

BECAUSE TRUTH IS, HARLY A FEW OF YOU CHANGE MUCH OF THE CORE C++.

SURE YOUR ALL HOOKING SCRIPTS INTO IT LEFT AND RIGHT.

BUT THE EXPENSIVE HIGH DOLLAR PROGRAMMERS DONT SEEM TO COME AROUND MUCH TO REALLY TUNE THE LOW LEVEL STUFF?

WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

BECAUSE WHEN YOUR OLDER ELDERS ARE AROUND YOU SHOULD LEARN TO FIND SOME GROUND.
```

Holy lowest of codename expectations, in what universe are you from at what point in time upstream?

Just exactly what is the avg age of the current mythtv dev group does anyone know?
