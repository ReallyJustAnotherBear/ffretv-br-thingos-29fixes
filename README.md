Whats is ffretv-myththangos?
Whats the references to the name?

FFRETV is  a project of mine based of mythtv, thangos is a further customized project based off THingOS.

Furthermore, mythtv is based of qt/ffmpeg/mysql, and ThingOS is based off Buildroot.

It's the great fun world of software develoment that even a non-pro like myself gets to play with.

I was going to say a lot more here, but decided I'll use social media to chastise mythtv upstream with my opinions, if I feel the need to.
